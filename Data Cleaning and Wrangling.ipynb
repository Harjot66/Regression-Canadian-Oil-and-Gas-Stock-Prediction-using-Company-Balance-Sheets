    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we want to create a stock price prediction model using company balance sheet values for various Canadian oil and gas companies. We will be using the Python Yahoo Finance API to get the data, then we would be utilizing Python for data wrangling and cleaning, then we would switch into R, where we would go ahead and attempt to create a powerful regression model to predict the stock price off of a given oil and gas company's balance sheet values. From my accounting knowledge, it was decided that utilizing a balance sheet for stock price prediction would make the most sense as this is the one company financial statement which provides a snapshot in time, whereas other financial statements provide values over a certain period of time. This regression model would then be able to be used for a strategy of value investing within the oil and gas industry.\n",
